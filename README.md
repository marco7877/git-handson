## what is git?

Git is a version control manager. SO yes, you can actually use it to track changes on your thesis instead of having :

* final version
* final final version
* final version (god save me)
* final final final version (I want my degree)

So, git was developed by the same human that created the Linux kernel. Gossip says that he created it
because it was a mess to keep track of the work done to the linux kernel (the jellies of linux). So this means that git 
is a tool that will let you track changes, go back in time, but also colaborate with other people. Sooo cool! :fire:

Now, you can use git in any OS that you want, which makes it super powerful. To start using git you need a git account, either from evil *Microsoft* :imp: (**github**) or from cool hippies :angel:  (**GitLab**). You can always use github and say people that you started using it before it was sold to Microsoft!
